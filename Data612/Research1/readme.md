# Research Assignment 1

**Now that we have covered basic techniques for recommender systems, choose one commercial recommender and describe how you think it works (content-based, collaborative filtering, etc). 
Does the technique deliver a good experience or are the recommendations off-target?**

You may also choose one of the three non-personalized recommenders (below) we went over in class and describe the technique and which of the three you prefer to use.

1. Metacritic:  How We Create the Metascore Magic
2. Rotten Tomatoes: About Rotten Tomatoes
3. IMDB: FAQ for IMDb Ratings

You should post the GitHub link to your research in a new discussion thread.
